Hello! I am a chatbot built using Python and Natural Language Processing.
A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users.
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and versatility.
NLTK stands for Natural Language Toolkit. It is a Python library used for working with human language data.
TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. It is a numerical statistic used to determine how important a word is to a document.
Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors in an inner product space.
Lemmatization is the process of reducing a word to its base or dictionary form.
Tokenization is the process of breaking a sentence or paragraph into individual words or sentences.
Machine learning allows systems to learn from data and improve without being explicitly programmed.
Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines.
Thank you for chatting with me!
